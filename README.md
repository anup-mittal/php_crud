2. Clone this repo at path "c:\xampp\htdocs" so that you get a folder named "php_crud" inside htdocs folder.
3. Open Xampp control panel and start Apache and MySql services.
4. Create a database with name "test" in mysql using PhpMyAdmin.
5. Import customer.sql file into your database to create the table with sample data.
6. Hit link "http://localhost/php_crud/read.php" to launch the dashboard of crud operation.
